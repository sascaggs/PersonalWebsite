They are very useful kind of model because they are suited to the hierarchical and nested organization of the world around us. In this post, I will demonstrate how to build, describe, and compare multilevel models using tools from brms.\nFor this demonstration, let’s model the palmerpenguins dataset made available on github by Allison Horst. These data contain morphometrics for three species of penguins – Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie – and the names of the islands they inhabit in Antarctica."

    "text": "Start simple\nLet’s model penguin body mass (body_mass_g). A simple starting model would be to estimate the central tendency and variation in body masses across all penguins. We can do this by estimating the parameters mu (\\(\\mu\\)) and sigma (\\(\\sigma\\)) with a Gaussian family.\nFor now, we will use the default brms priors. You can view them by calling the model formula, data, and family:\n\nget_prior(body_mass_g ~ 1, \n          family = gaussian(), data = d)\n\n                     prior     class coef group resp dpar nlpar lb ub  source\n student_t(3, 4050, 889.6) Intercept                                  default\n    student_t(3, 0, 889.6)     sigma                             0    default\n\n\nThe model formula is truly as simple as it can be: body_mass_g ~ 1.

According to this model, the mean body mass (g) of all the Penguins is 4200.43, surrounded by 44.09 grams of error. This value is comparable to the value computed using base R (mean = 4201.75). This model also estimates a sigma value of 802.90, which is comparable to the standard deviation (sd = 801.95)\n\nposterior_summary(mod0)\n\n               Estimate   Est.Error        Q2.5       Q97.5\nb_Intercept  4202.24405 43.93026876  4115.67686  4289.96055\nsigma         804.00584 31.13987362   746.30603   865.65799\nlprior        -15.39316  0.03575543   -15.46696   -15.32878\nlp__        -2781.47280  0.98978812 -2784.21080 -2780.48072\n\n\nIf we generate 4000 draws from this model, and graph them, the distribution looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior distribution of body mass (g)."

    "text": "Species variation, fixed and random\nA sensible biologist might point out that body mass probably varies across each species of penguin. We can assess this by adding a fixed effect of species to our model that will estimate the body mass for each species. It will not, however, help us understand how body mass varies within each species. To do that, we need estimate random intercepts for each species group. We’ll fit both models to illustrate the difference.\nFor the fixed effect model, we add the species factor to our model formula:\n\nbody_mass_g ~ 1 + species\n\nto estimate a fixed intercept for each of the species groups in the dataset.\n\nmod1a <- brm(data = d, family = gaussian(),\n             body_mass_g ~ 1 + species)\n\n\n\n\nWe can examine the estimates by calling the model object inside the fixef() function.\n\nfixef(mod1a)\n\n                   Estimate Est.Error      Q2.5     Q97.5\nIntercept        3701.17778  36.52792 3629.7886 3774.4572\nspeciesChinstrap   31.57681  67.58873 -101.7963  163.4163\nspeciesGentoo    1374.24868  54.51842 1269.7078 1482.2137\n\n\nHere we see that the body mass of Adelie – the reference category for Intercept – and Chinstrap differ by just over 30 grams, while the mean for Gentoo is more than 1000 grams larger. Just how much these body mass measurements overlap is easier to see if we graph the posterior.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior distribution of body mass (g) for each penguin species.\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate random intercepts for each species, rather than fixed intercepts, we use the following model formula:\n\nbody_mass_g ~(1|species)\n\n\nmod1b <- brm(data = d, family = gaussian(),\n             body_mass_g ~ (1|species))\n\n\n\n\nThis model estimates a “global” fixed intercept:\n\nfixef(mod1b)\n\n          Estimate Est.Error     Q2.5    Q97.5\nIntercept  4130.29  459.9165 3156.383 5029.404\n\n\nand then separate random intercepts for each species, reported as differences from the global intercept:\n\nranef(mod1b)\n\n$species\n, , Intercept\n\n           Estimate Est.Error        Q2.5     Q97.5\nAdelie    -427.7364  461.8709 -1340.36322  554.2313\nChinstrap -394.6471  461.6474 -1314.66820  588.0133\nGentoo     941.2958  459.9377    28.34081 1914.2185\n\n\nUltimately, this model will produce posterior distributions that look very similar to the fixed effect model:\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior distribution of body mass (g) based on random intercepts for each penguin species.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a key difference between the fixed and random effects models. The random effects model has a much greater amount of uncertainty when compared to the fixed effects. This can be seen in the following dotplot, which shows the coefficient estimates for each model and the error around these estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept and beta coefficients fixed and random effects models. Lines indicate estimated error.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a tendency to view high uncertainty as a marker of defeat. This should not be the case. Having a better estimation of model uncertainty (combined with good theory) is a necessary condition for valid causal inference."

    "text": "This post is also available on the Social Ecological Networks Group.\n\n\n\nThe size of a network is determined by the number of vertices and edges within it, and different size networks have different structural properties. This is obviously true if social processes like homophily, preferential attachment, or triadic closure influence network size, but it is also true for randomly generated networks.\nHow do properties like density, sparseness, degree distribution, or connectivity change as the number of vertices in a network increases? To find out, I set up a few computational experiments for directed and undirected networks.\n\nSparse networks\nA graph is considered sparse if the number of edges, \\(m\\), is less the number of vertices, \\(n\\); a value given by \\(m < O(n)\\), the orthogonal group. As the number of vertices increases, the density at which a network is considered sparse decreases. Additionally, this negative relationship differs for undirected and directed networks, because the maximum edges in a directed graph is given by \\(n(n-1)\\) whereas in an undirected graph, it is \\(n(n-1)/2\\).\nGenerally speaking, the point at which any network becomes sparse (\\(S\\)) is the ratio between the orthogonal set and the maximum number of possible edges. For a directed network, this is given by:\n\\[S = \\frac{O(n)}{n(n-1)}\\]\nAnd for an undirected network:\n\\[S = \\frac{O(n)}{n(n-1)/2}\\]\nSo if we vary \\(n\\) and plot the value of \\(S\\), we can see how this threshold changes for different size networks. Here is a function to do this:\n\nsparsepoint <- function(n, directed=F) {\n  if ( directed == F  )   { n / (n*(n-1)/2) }\n  else if ( directed == T ) { n / (n*(n-1))   }\n  else { \n    print('Must be TRUE or FALSE.')\n  }\n}\n\n\nsparsepoint(100)\n\n[1] 0.02020202\n\nsparsepoint(100, directed = T)\n\n[1] 0.01010101\n\n\nNow we can create a sequence of \\(n\\) values and graph the results. Figure 1 shows what this function looks like as \\(n\\) increases from 1 to 10000. When a network is smaller than 1000 vertices, the sparsepoint is occurs between 0.5% and 2% density. The dropoff occurs more slowly for undirected networkss. Above 1000 vertices, the sparsepoint for both directed and undirected networks begins to converge on 0.01% density.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density at which a network is considered sparse as a function of the number of vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree distribution\nFor a network of any size, as the edge density increases, the degree distribution is expected to become more uniform, with the mean degree starting to approximate \\(n\\). To see how degree distribution changes with edge density, we can calculate degree for each node across a variety of density levels. Here I do this for networks with 10, 75, and 150 vertices, each ranging in density from 0.01 to 0.99.\n\nd <- seq(0.01,0.99, length.out=11)\nl <- list()\nfor(i in seq_along(d)) {\n  l[[i]] <- network(10, directed = F, density = d[i])\n  m <- data.frame(lapply(l, degree))\n}\ncolnames(m) <- paste0('Density',d)\nhead(m)\n\n  Density0.01 Density0.108 Density0.206 Density0.304 Density0.402 Density0.5\n1           0            0            2            6            8         12\n2           0            0            4            8            8         10\n3           0            0            4           10            8          6\n4           0            2            4            8           10         10\n5           0            0            6            8            8         10\n6           0            0            2            6            6          6\n  Density0.598 Density0.696 Density0.794 Density0.892 Density0.99\n1           10           16           16           14          18\n2           10           12           18           16          18\n3            4           12           18           14          18\n4           10           16           14           16          18\n5           14           10           14           14          12\n6           12           10           18           16          18\n\n\nI do this for each network size and then plot the distributions to compare.\n\n\n\n\n\nA comparison of the degree distributions at increasing levels of density for three different size networks.\n\n\n\n\nThe degree distributions of networks that have only a couple hundred vertices or less can overlap quite a bit across different levels of edge density. Large networks have a much more precise degree distribution. This makes it clear why descriptive statistics that depend on density cannot easily be compared between different networks, unless the networks are large.\n\n\nAverage Path Length\nThe length of a path between two vertices is determined by the number of vertices that lie between them. A direct path between two vertices is equal to 1.\nWe observed that as \\(m\\) increases, mean degree approaches \\(n\\). We can expect that when mean degree is approximately \\(n\\), the average path length should be approximately 1.\nThe function below accepts a sequence of densities and a number of vertices, and returns the mean degree and average path length at each level of density.\n\nl <- list()\napl <- c()\n\nDegApl <- function(n, directed = F, d, seed=777) {\n  for(i in seq_along(d)) {\n    l[[i]] <- network(n, directed = directed, \n                      density = d[i], seed=seed)\n    m <- data.frame(lapply(l, degree))\n    k <- lapply(l, geodist, inf.replace = 0, count.paths = F)\n    apl[i] <- mean(k[[i]]$gdist)\n  }\n  remove(l,k) \n  colnames(m) <- c(1:length(d))\n  mD <- apply(m, 2, mean)\n  return(cbind(apl,mD,n,d))\n}\n\nNow we can explore relationships between these variables by running this function on networks with different sizes. Here we use a long sequence of densities to better approximate relationships.\n\n\n\nWe can expect that mean degree and density are positively correlated. But what is the shape of this relationship?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between edge density and mean degree is approximately linear.\n\n\n\n\nAverage path length should also systematically vary with density, but it is unclear what the shape of this relationship will look like. For instance, at low density, many paths = 0 because many vertices are isolated. However, dense networks should have short paths, as most vertices are directly connected to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplosive percolation of average path length\n\n\n\n\nAt very low density (0.01), the average path length is essentially 0, but just a small increase in density leads to explosive increase in the average path length. This phenomenon is an example of explosive percolation, and it occurs because even randomly added edges have a chance of connecting isolated vertices to a large component.\nThis explosion happens even sooner for networks with a greater number of vertices. Exactly when does this percolation happen? At the sparsepoint (!) which we know varies systematically as a function of \\(n\\). Because the density at which a network goes from being sparse to not sparse decreases as a function of network size, we see explosive changes in average path length sooner and sooner as network size increases.\nAs we continue to increase density, the average path length decreases because the number of direct paths between vertices that are part of the largest component continues to increase, and this drives down the average path length. Eventually the average path length for networks of all sizes converges on 1."

    "text": "Food webs are representations of the feeding relationships between plants, animals, and other organisms in an ecosystem. Ecologists will often use network graphs and network analysis to describe and analyze these feeding relationships. A major goal of theoretical ecology is coming up with models that can be used describe empirical food webs. A good place to start this process is by simulating feeding relationships. Network science and computation can help us do this.\nIn this post, I develop a simulation of a food web based on body size and dietary strategy. My goal is to understand some of the structural implications that arise from these two drivers. This is a work in progress.\n\n\n\n\nSpecies attributes\nThe first thing I’m going to do is generate some species attributes. These attributes includes things we might measure about species (e.g., body size) and categories we might place different species in (e.g., trophic level).\nFirst, let’s imagine have 25 species from four different trophic levels: carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, and autotroph.\n\nset.seed(777)\nN = 25\ntrophs = c('carn','omni','herb','auto')\n\nWe can sample with replacement from a vector of these trophic levels to assign each species to one of them. If we use the default prob in the sample function, each level is sampled with equal probability. This is something we might want to change to reflect empirical food webs. For example, there tend to be a lot of plants and carnivores, and relatively fewer omnivores and herbivores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to assign each species a body size. This is somewhat awkward to do for plants (autotrophs), so for simplicity, we’ll assume that plant body size refereces to the total edible biomass of that particular plant, on average.\nSince body sizes are always positive, continuous values, I’ll use a gamma distribution.\n\nbody_size = rgamma(N, shape = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we have many species that are pretty small and some a bit larger. The units here are pretty arbitrary but maybe we think of them as hundreds of pounds.\nNow I can store all of these in a data frame.\n\nd = data.frame(\n    species = 1:N, \n    troph = sample( trophs, size = N, replace = TRUE, prob =  c(0.3,0.1,0.1,0.5) ), \n    body_size = rgamma(N, shape = 2)\n)\nhead(d)\n\n  species troph body_size\n1       1  auto 4.5290711\n2       2  auto 0.5468126\n3       3  carn 0.9878395\n4       4  auto 1.5093469\n5       5  auto 3.0427018\n6       6  carn 1.4672133"
